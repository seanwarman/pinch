# pinch

A sample looper that you can play with a keyboard.

Here's how to use it.

The keys on the screen line up with the keys on your computer keyboard.
Press one to loop a sample and press more than one to loop samples together.

You can press them again to stop the loops.

Hold the `shift` and a letter key (eg `e`) to enter 'sample-select' mode. Then click
on the right-hand menu to choose which sample you want to assign to the
key you're holding.
